# PhylogeneticTreeBuilder

This repository contains tools and scripts for building and visualizing phylogenetic trees using sequence alignment and other techniques.

## Overview

The PhylogeneticTreeBuilder project provides a set of tools that enable researchers to:
- Load sequence data and metadata
- Perform sequence alignment
- Build phylogenetic trees
- Visualize phylogenetic trees

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `data/`: Directory containing sequence data and metadata files.
- `scripts/`: Directory containing Python scripts for sequence alignment and tree building.
- `notebooks/`: Directory containing Jupyter Notebook examples and analyses.
- `results/`: Directory for storing the results of the analysis, including aligned sequences and tree visualizations.

## Usage

1. **Load Data**: Place your sequence data in the `data/sequences.fasta` file and your metadata in the `data/metadata.csv` file.

2. **Perform Sequence Alignment**: Run the `sequence_alignment.py` script to align sequences and generate `results/aligned_sequences.fasta`.

3. **Build Phylogenetic Tree**: Run the `tree_builder.py` script to build a phylogenetic tree and save it as `results/tree.nwk`.

4. **Visualize Phylogenetic Tree**: Run the `tree_visualization.py` script to visualize the phylogenetic tree and save it as `results/tree.png`.

5. **Example Analysis**: Check out the `notebooks/PhylogeneticTreeBuilder.ipynb` notebook for an example analysis using the tools provided.

## Dependencies

This project uses the Biopython library for sequence analysis and tree building. Make sure you have it installed in your Python environment.

```bash
pip install biopython
